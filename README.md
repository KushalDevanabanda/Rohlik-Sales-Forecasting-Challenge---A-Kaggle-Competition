# Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge - A-Kaggle Competition
The "Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge" on Kaggle tasks participants with predicting sales of online groceries. Using historical sales data, competitors create models to forecast demand, optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotions. Itâ€™s a chance to showcase skills in time-series forecasting and predictive analytics.

Rohlik Group, a leading European e-grocery innovator, is revolutionising the food retail industry. The company operates across 11 warehouses in Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Romania.

The company is now transitioning from the Rohlik Orders Forecasting Challenge to the Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge. This challenge focuses on predicting the sales of each selected warehouse inventory for next 14 days using historical sales data.

I participated in this competition along with my two friends Venky and Vishnu. We have been looking out to working together on something for a long time and found this competition in Kaggle.
We did not finish with a great rank, but we had a lot of fun and learnt a lot while working on this challenge.

**Final Result:** 271 out of 777. Public score: **20.86121**, Private score: **20.24298**.

**Final Submission**
LightGBM-based model was utilized with feature engineering that incorporates temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and specific store behaviors. Key features include date-related attributes, warehouse-specific conditions, and custom lag features for sales data. Additionally, a critical improvement is made by integrating the year-over-year sales growth, considering the natural increase in sales over time, which helps the model account for long-term trends.

We have used other gradient-boosting methods like XGBoost and CatBoost method but found that LighGBM results were more accurate.
