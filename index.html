    The <strong>Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge</strong> on Kaggle tasks participants with predicting sales of online groceries. Using historical sales data, competitors create models to forecast demand, optimizing inventory, pricing, and promotions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rohlik Group, a leading European e-grocery innovator, operates across 11 warehouses in Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Romania. This challenge focuses on predicting the sales of each selected warehouse inventory for the next 14 days.
  </p>

    I participated in this competition with my friends Venkatesh and Vishnu. While we didnâ€™t rank high, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Final Result:</strong> 271 out of 777. Public score: 20.86121, Private score: 20.24298.</p>

  </p>
  <p>
    Our final submission used a LightGBM-based model with features like temporal patterns, seasonal trends, and warehouse-specific behaviors. We also added a multiplier (1.05) to account for year-over-year sales growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    We tried XGBoost and CatBoost, but LightGBM gave better results. We believe combining all three could have further improved our CV scores.
  </p>

  <h3>Missed Opportunities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We skipped lag features and log transformations that had helped in other models.</li>
    <li>Using moving averages to fill nulls could have helped.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approaches That Didnâ€™t Work</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adding more features didnâ€™t help</li>
    <li>Training on MAE gave bad results</li>
    <li>Cosine/sine time features worsened performance</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Decision trees struggle with extrapolation</li>
    <li>Our simple multiplier adjustment gave solid improvements</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Weâ€™ve attached our final file and other models in this GitHub repo. We hope this helps others in their forecasting work!
